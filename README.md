#About <br />
This is a Discord Bot using Python to assist players and Dungeon Masters in Dungeons and Dragons. It is built
to store all of a guilds info into one database. Its intentions are to provide players with tools that will 
prevent repetitive tasks. Storing data like character information, weapons, and more will allow the bot to
quickly access it and use it.
