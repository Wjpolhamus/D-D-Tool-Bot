âš¡About <br />
---
This is a Discord Bot using Python to assist players and Dungeon Masters in Dungeons and Dragons. It is built
to store all of a guilds info into one database. Its intentions are to provide players with tools that will 
prevent repetitive tasks. Storing data like character information, weapons, and more will allow the bot to
quickly access it and use it. This is a work in progress, more of a project to learn about individual parts,
like security, databases, and modularity in code. I wanted to use this repo to keep track of everything and
keep it professional.

Libraries + More
---
For testing of the bot I hosted through my own computer. As the bot is developed, if it somehow gains some
types of following, than I would use services to store the data, and to allow the bot to be running 24/7. 
But as for the specific Libaries and Software used, here is what I have:

-mysql-connector-python <br />
-discord-py <br />
-Apache2 <br />
-mysql <br />
-Mariadb <br />
-phpmyadmin <br />

Usage of this bot
---
It will be rather simply to operate this bot, as all of the commands are just options you can click. 
Adding the bot to your discord will create a channel dedicated for these commands, and you will be able
to alter this how you would like. To prevent spam, the messages do not stay, and prompts disppear. The 
bot will need to collect your information from characters, and more about the campaign. But after it will
work its magic and you only need to click commands.

Commands
---
Amongst many more coming, the working commands as of now are;

-add_character <br />
-add_weapon <br />
-encounter <br />
-find_weapon <br />
This bot will not be limited to just commands that help you find your information, but also will implement random
generators that can help you improvise better with loot, phrases, etc.
